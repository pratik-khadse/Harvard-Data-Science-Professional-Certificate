This repository contains 2 captsone projects I worked on while pursuing the online Harvard Data Science Professional Certificate.

1. Movielens Recommendation system: 
Developed and assessed Regularized Linear models for generating recommendation system using MovieLens dataset consisting of 10M records in RStudio, realizing a final linear model with a prediction error 8.5% lower compared to the baseline model.

2. Online Rental Listings Price Prediction
Created regression models to predict listing prices for an online rental platform employing minimum number of factors. Compared and identified models with the best fit using RMSE and R Square measurement, improving the latter by 18% on baseline model.
